The Impact of Nutrition and Diet on Oral Health 

Zohoori, F. V., & Duckworth, R. M. (Eds.). (2019). The Impact of Nutrition and Diet on Oral Health. Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers.


The publication of this text contributes a valuable and timely contribution to the discipline of nutrition and oral health. The editors have compiled a wide range of relevant topics and produced an evidence- based monograph on nutrition that would be a welcome addition to university libraries, dental professionals, nutritionists and other health care workers with an interest in the impact of diet on health. It is particularly timely as there have been few recent updates to other classical textbooks on this subject and in the era of social media proliferation of ‘nutribabble’ with the latest dietary fads.

Given the importance of preventive approaches and dental disease more guidance on dietary intervention or assessment techniques, changes in nutrient requirements through the life cycle and specific effects of food- derived constituents in modifying the progression of dental caries would have been useful
The oral effects of the growth in the use of non-nutritive sweeteners or sugar polyols and starch hydrolysates as food ingredients is still under-researched(///blk- check See sugar book). Eating patterns and the anticariogenic effect of specific food constituents requires further reseaerch
